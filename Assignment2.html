	I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.Before coming to Stanford,
	I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent(now part of IBM).At Taligent,I worked on Places for Project Teams,a groupware product
	designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams.I was fortunate to work with the 
	Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle-from initial product conception through the actual product launch.
	<BR/><BR/>
	I have a Ph.D. from the University of California,Irvine,where I specialized in Software Engineering.
	My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams.I also have a masters degree from Irvine,with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence,
	and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
